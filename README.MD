# Advent of Code 2021

## Using Rust


 - Day 8: Took a long time and lots of code 
 - Day 9: part 2 is a little slow, and it could probably be optimized
 - Day 14: cheated a bit for part 2
 - Day 15: used dijsktra's  its slow for part 2, but i think there are a couple different things i could do to optizise it for part to.
    1. grow the grid sections as necessary instead of all at once 
    2. research ways to optimize dijsktra, priority queue??
 - Day 17: There has to be a better solution than the crap i came up with! Its not that slow but i hate the whole try_again thing i came up with.
