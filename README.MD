# Advent of Code 2021

## Using Rust


 - Day 8: Took a long time and lots of code 
 - Day 9: part 2 is a little slow, and it could probably be optimized
 - Day 14: cheated a bit for part 2
 - Day 15: used dijsktra's, but its slow for part 2. I'm betting I could make it faster.
    1. Try growing the grid sections as necessary instead of all at once 
    2. Use a priority queue?
 - Day 17: There has to be a better solution than the crap i came up with! Its not that slow but i hate the whole try_again thing..
 - Day 18: Part 2 is slow, but i'm happy with my solution
 - Day 19: FAILED!
 - Day 21: Almost had part 2 on my own, but had to refer to other submissions to get it
